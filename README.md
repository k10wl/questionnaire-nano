This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Aight, not gonna lie, I ran out of time on this project (but met the deadline and requirement).
Just keep in mind, some of the decisions were made to speed up development process,
such as questionnaire lib.
If I had more time - I would come up with a better solution in some places.
